The dataset is cleaned, and feature engineering is performed for better model performance.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The goal of EDA is to uncover insights and relationships in the data that influence the car's price. The following steps were taken:

### 1. üîß Data Overview

- Checked dataset shape, column types, and null values.
- Found no missing values in the dataset.

### 2. üìä Univariate Analysis

- **Price Distribution**: Car prices are right-skewed with a few high-end models.
- **Fuel Type**: Majority of cars use `gas`; a smaller portion uses `diesel`.
- **Aspiration**: Most cars have standard aspiration; some have turbo.
- **Car Body**: `sedan`, `hatchback`, and `wagon` are the most common types.
- **Drive Wheel**: `fwd` (front-wheel drive) dominates the dataset.
  Visualizations were created using:
- `seaborn` (heatmaps, bar plots, boxplots)
- `matplotlib` (distribution plots, histograms)
### 4. üîÅ Correlation Matrix

- Created a heatmap of correlations to identify multicollinearity.
- Key positively correlated features with `price`:
  - `enginesize`
  - `horsepower`
  - `curbweight`
  - `carwidth`

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

Steps involved:

- Dropping irrelevant columns like `Car_Name`.
- Creating a new column `Current_Year` and deriving `Car_Age`.
- Encoding categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()`.
- Feature scaling and train-test splitting.

## ü§ñ Model Building

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### üìå Best Performing Model

The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy and lowest error, making it the best choice for deployment.

## üìà Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:

- **R¬≤ Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Cross-Validation Scores**

The Random Forest model consistently showed the best performance across these metrics.

## üíæ Model Saving

The best model (Random Forest Regressor) was saved using the `pickle` library for future use in deployment or app integration.

```python
import pickle
file = open('random_forest_model.pkl','wb')
pickle.dump(model, file)
